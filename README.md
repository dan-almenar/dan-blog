# Dan Blog
This project is ment to be the blog app for [my personal web](https://danielalmenar.com).

I've chosen SvelteKit as a framework to develop this app, for I think it's both simple and robust enough as to accelerate the development process, which is a decisive factor for me, given the small blocks of time I have on a daily bases for personal projects.

Most likely the deployment will be as a dockerized app, since it will facilitate the integration of this app onto the main app. The code for my personal web may be found [here](https://github.com/dan-almenar/go-react-ts-portfolio).

I'm leaving bellow the regular content of the Readme file that gets created with SvelteKit.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
